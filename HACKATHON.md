## Concept

### Reasons why we need mentorships

1. [Mentorship is key To diversity and inclusion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2019/09/26/the-key-to-diversity-and-inclusion-is-mentorship/#59143e057fbd)
1. [Mentorships help build trusting relationships and foster belonging in the workplace](https://hello.cultureamp.com/hubfs/1703-Belonging/Culture-Amp_6-ways-to-foster-belonging.pdf)

### Problems with traditional formal mentorships

1. Finding mentors requires an established network or access to one
1. Typically formal mentorship programs are watilisted or are not offered year-round
1. Poorly structured or undefined expectations can lead to a failed mentorship
1. Peer mentorships are typically not included

### How this platform could help

- Focussing on more specific skills and immediate needs
- Structured requests...
  - to encourage mentee to define their motivations, goals and expectations (before finding a mentor)
  - to make the best use of the mentors time and help them know where to focus
  - identify shorter commitments to get a broad range of participants
- Matching happens when the request is made
- Tagging profiles with keywords and skills to automate matches

Other ideas...

- Mentorship can happen async  (email?) to unlocking timezones and personal circumstances
- When making a request, force the mentee to put a time
- Mentor can develop an outline based on the request
- Encourage "there are no stupid questions"
- Login with LinkedIn and prefill profile

#### Potential pitfalls

- Social networkish feel can be difficult
- Matching personalities
- Vetting mentors qualifications or level of experience
- Monitoring code of conduct
- LMGTFY
- Internal vs external mentorship program pros/cons
